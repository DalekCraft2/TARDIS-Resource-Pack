# TARDIS-Resource-Pack

Resource pack for the TARDIS v4.2 (and higher) plugin, as well as TARDISWeepingAngels and the Vortex Manipulator

A TARDIS based resource pack for the [TARDIS](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/tardis/) Spigot/Paper plugin. This pack takes advantage of the Connected textures Mod (for TARDIS blocks) and Custom Item Textures (for TARDISWeepingAngels monsters) available when using [OptiFine](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272953). All other items use custom model data to change TARDIS item textures, and unused mushroom block states for other TARDIS blocks.
